## This is an interactive web application developed with Streamlit that allows users to convert files into Word (.docx) and PDF (.pdf) formats. The app is designed to be easy to use, with an intuitive interface and minimalist design where they can upload the file and convert it to the opposite format with just a few clicks.

## Features

- **Environment Configuration:** Clone the project repository, create a virtual environment (optional but recommended), and install the necessary dependencies using a requirements.txt file
- **Application Development:** Import the necessary libraries, configure the logging level to suppress information and warning messages, and configure the style of the application to have a dark background and white text. Create the user interface with Streamlit, allowing file uploads and displaying details of the uploaded file. Implement logic to convert PDFs to Word and Word to PDFs based on the type of file uploaded, and provide buttons to download the converted files.
- **Running and deploying the application:** Run the application locally using Streamlit and create a repository on GitHub to upload the project's code, documenting it in a README.md file and including installation and usage instructions.
- **Maintenance and Upgrade:** Monitor and resolve issues reported on GitHub, and keep dependencies up to date to ensure project compatibility and security.

## Technologies used
